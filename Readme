A fork of the Cold War Enhancement mod to continue it in a semi-official capacity. Contains many changes from the original, including a new social democratic ideology and advanced compatibility with Project Alice ( https://github.com/schombert/Project-Alice ).
 
The mod does share the discord with CWE, but we ask you to report bugs on the GitHub as well: https://github.com/ccfox/CWE-FoxFork/issues

Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Glariamn, whose work on ideologies inspired the social democratic ideology https://github.com/settintotrieste/Victoria-2-Cold-War-Enhancement-Mod-CWE/pull/415.
Thanks to all those who helped contribute to and help maintain the mod!
